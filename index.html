                    Hello, I am <em><b>Albert Einstein</b></em> and I was born at Ulm, in Wurttemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879.
                    I was grew up in Munich, where my father founded an electrical engineering company.
                    After studying at the ETH university in Zurich, I worked at the patent office 
                    in Bern, during which time I produced several pioneering works in the field of physics. 
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
                    I am a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held as one of the most influential scientists. 
                    I am Best known for developing the theory of relativity, I also made important contributions to 
                    quantum mechanics. My mass-energy equivalence formula E = mc^2, which arises from special relativity, 
                    has been called "the world's most famous equation". I received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics 
                    "for my services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the 
                    photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. I received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.
                    My Famous Quotations are: We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. <em><b>"Learn from yesterday, 
                    live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning."</b></em>

                            In classical physics, time was viewed as an absolute and universal quantity, flowing at a 
                            constant rate independent of external factors. This notion, proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, 
                            treated time as separate from space, forming the backdrop against which physical events unfold.
